            Boston Taiwanese Biotechnology Association (BTBA) was founded in * 2012 by a group of Taiwanese graduate students, postdocs and young professionals in the greater Boston area. Our goals are to enhance scientific collaborations, to foster individual career development, to facilitate interactions and to strengthen networking among academic and industrial bioscience communities in Taiwan and the US. We hold annual symposiums that attract more than 350 young Taiwanese professionals from biology-related fields across the US.

BTBA also hosts seminars and workshops regularly throughout the year. We serve as a platform to foster a community for young scientists to share their research, exchange ideas, and explore career opportunities. BTBA also collaborates with local and out-of-state organizations in programs that align with our mission to strengthen the bioscience communities in Taiwan and the US.
